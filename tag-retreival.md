## Retrieving lost tags

Lotek NanoTags can be retrieved by manually tracking the tag with a
Lotek handheld receiver. Since these receivers have a long range at full
gain, it can take a long time to locate a tag that has been lost, but
manual tracking is still routine for researchers . When touching the
ground, the tag signal is modulated enough that a trained ear can
actually identify the tag as being detached just by the quality of the
audio signal the receiver emits.

Without a Lotek receiver you can use the open-source SensorGnome
receivers instead, but they are much more difficult to use in this way
since there is a longer time delay between when a detection occurs and
when it shows up on the receiverâ€™s display. Further, SensorGnome
receivers do not offer a real-time gain adjustment, whereas Lotek
receivers do.
