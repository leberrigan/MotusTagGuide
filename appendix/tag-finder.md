# Tag Finder

Tag finder is an algorithm written by John Brzustowski which is designed to search for specific signatures of radio pulses which match known tag identifiers. The is essentially the method by which Motus identifies Lotek radio tag from raw data and assigns a Motus Tag ID. For more information about Lotek tag signals, see [How Tags Work](../how-tags-work.md#lotek-radio-tags).  

This is a complex algorithm which deservers its own detailed documentation that we will not include here. To find out more about tag finder, see the links below:
