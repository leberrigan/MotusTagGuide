## Tag Harness sizes

This table lists harness sizes for the pre-fabricated ‘figure eight’ leg loop harness method based on real sizes used on individuals tagged in the field. Sizes include the length of the entire single leg-loop, but do not include overlap with the tag. Weights can be used to help specify which harness size to use.

Please note that these are guidelines. Regardless of what sizes you find here, the harness should always be fitted to the individual. Please see a [**How to Tag Animals**](https://docs.motus.org/tagguide/tag-deployment#how-to-tag-animals) for more information.

## **How to avoid tag aliasing**

Aliasing can occur when multiple tags emit a signal at the same time. Sometimes these interacting signals can produce a pattern which match a different tag that is not actually present. This is due to the nature of how the unique tag ID is encoded in the signal. However, the parameters used to define these IDs are quite stringent, making aliasing only an issue in specific conditions.

### _Strategic tag deployment_

To help mitigate aliasing, we recommend keeping numbers low at any given tagging site. This can be done by staggering deployments, either spatially or temporally. Most aliasing is caused by tags which have the same burst interval but a different Lotek ID. That means if you have more than one burst interval in your selection of tags, you can deploy more tags at any given site with a reduced risk of aliasing. However, do not deploy more than one tag with the same Lotek ID, even if they have different burst intervals!
