# Tag Storage

## Tag metadata

One of the most important aspects of tag storage is ensuring your tag metadata is up to date. Motus needs to know which tags are not deployed, otherwise they might be reissued by the manufacturer which can have bad consequences like ambiguous detections. W

## **Storing battery-powered tags**

The steps below follow the best available guidance in consultation with the tag manufacturers:

1. Upon receipt, it is important to turn tags on, inspect their performance, and ideally register them with Motus immediately after receiving them from the manufacturer. After checking, and before storing, it’s important to verify that the transmitters have been deactivated!
2. Tags are best kept in static free packaging and a closed box from the manufacturer to avoid exposure to light. Exposure to light during storage can increase energy consumption, and reduce battery and tag life. Practice physical distancing of tags – avoid storing transmitters in direct contact with other transmitters or on metallic surfaces.
3. Store transmitters in a relatively cool (10-20°C), dry and well-ventilated area. In places that are naturally hot and humid, a fridge >=\~4C, but not colder may be OK. Silica packets can help to keep boxes dry in this scenario. Fridges are not well ventilated and condensation could interfere with tag electronics over time. **Do not store tags in a freezer.**

Remember that your tag warranty ends after the 'expected' lifespan of the tag has expired, beginning from the date of shipment. That means most tags which are stored for later use will no longer be covered by warranty. This is why it is especially important to ensure tags are working upon receipt, rather than immediately before deployment.
