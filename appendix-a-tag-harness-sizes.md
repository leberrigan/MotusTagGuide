# Appendix A: Tag Harness Sizes

This table lists harness sizes for the pre-fabricated ‘figure eight’ leg loop harness method based on real sizes used on individuals tagged in the field. Sizes include the length of the entire single leg-loop, but do not include overlap with the tag. Weights can be used to help specify which harness size to use.

Please note that these are guidelines. Regardless of what sizes you find here, the harness should always be fitted to the individual. Please see a [**How to Tag Animals**](https://docs.motus.org/tagguide/tag-deployment#how-to-tag-animals) for more information.
